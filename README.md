### SPUI Editor
This new SPUI editor allows you to create or edit user interfaces. This is an example of what you can do with it:

### Other features

- It has automatic updates, so you can always have the latest update without having to worry about anything.
- A fast workflow. Convert the files, pack the mod and run the game in just one click.
- Texture viewer, including most of the ones SporeMaster couldn't convert. Supports viewing .rw4, .dds and .raster textures.
- Can convert .tlsa, .pctp, .raster, .spui files.
- Some bugfixes SporeMaster needed. For example, now 'string8s' and 'transform' properties work correctly.

To download the program, you just have to go to https://github.com/Emd4600/SporeModder/releases/latest and download the file "SporeModder.BETA.1.0.0.zip".

To open the program execute the file SporeModder Launcher.exe. This one will check for updates and download them as necessary. Your antivirus/firewall might complain about SporeModder trying to connect to the internet; it's just connecting to GitHub to check for updates, so there's no danger.

SporeModder is still in a beta stage, and it can contain bugs and errors; please, if you have any suggestion or bug report, comment and report it here or in GitHub.

The program is still a bit slower searching files, so it's recommended to use SporeMaster for that instead.

Here you have some example projects (just put them in the Projects folder) so you can see how to use SporeModder: http://www.mediafire.com/file/1wyhirfppstxdeh/SporeModder_Example_Projects.rar
